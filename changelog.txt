Version 1.5 (23-Feb-2015)
=========================
- Supports ASM 5.x (tested with version 5.0.3).
- EXPERIMENTAL: degrades gracefully to support ASM 4.x.
  Uses reflection to identify ASM 5, and if not found falls back to the ASM 4
  code path (and hack) from patch version 1.4.  If the reflection causes
  problems for users it may be removed in a future version.
- Verified behavior on Oracle jdk-8u31.



Version 1.4 (23-Feb-2015)
=========================
- Self test output includes patch version and build date for identification.
- Supports ASM 4.x (tested with version 4.2).
- Uses a hack to bypass ASM4 bytecode version checking; ASM4 does not support
  Java 8 bytecode natively.  Hacked by changing the bytecode major version number.
  This seems to work as long as the affected class does not use any new bytecode
  instructions.
- Maven dependency on ASM uses new group coordinate: org.ow2.asm (was: asm).
- Due to binary incompatibilities between ASM versions, does NOT work with ASM 3!
- Verified behavior on Oracle jdk-8u31.



Version 1.3 (06-Jan-2015)
=========================
- Functionally equivalent to version 1.0.

- FIXED: code contained erroneous super call to the wrong super method.
  The mistake did not appear to impact the correct application of the patch.

- Version number scheme changed for future support of newer ASM versions.
  The new convention uses the minor version ('x' in 1.x) to indicate the compatible
  major version of the ASM library.  Version 1.3 is compatible with ASM 3.x (tested
  with ASM 3.1).  Because of the new scheme, versions 1.1 and 1.2 were skipped.

- jCenter Maven coordinate changed. (Sorry!)
    group   : com.pros.opensource.java
    artifact: jdk8patch-halfupround-asm
    version : 1.3



Version 1.0 (31-Oct-2014)
=========================
- Uses ASM 3.1, will *NOT* work with ASM >= 4.

- Self test passes using Oracle Java 6, 7, 8 (GA), 8u25, and 8u40-ea-b12.

- Published to jCenter at Maven coordinates
    group   : com.pros.opensource.java
    artifact: jdk8patch-halfupround-asm31
    version : 1.0

NOTE: Pre-1.0 versions are not listed.
